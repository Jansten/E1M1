# TVGP Style Guide

## Overview

The standards below are what you should use each time you use the logo, styling, or artwork for the flagship TVGP show or any related show.

## Logo Use

* The controller cable **should not** be used on anything other than the show's album art
	* Older pieces of art are grandfathered in
* The full logo is the entire "controller" design without the cable
* The logo should never be split into individual elements (just the show's full name, just the "TVGP" portion, etc) unless explicitly stated for specific, one-off cases
* All derivative or transformative logos for use in any show, art, merch, etc needs to have final approval by Michael "Boston" Hannon before they're used

## Logo Colors (Hex)
* "TVGP Grey" AKA the background color: 333333
* "Controller" light border: c7c7c7
	* This is also the same color used on the inside borders of all the buttons on the "controller"
* "Controller" inside color: 6b6b6b
* TV button color: 222327
* GP button's red color: b53237
