# TVGP - General Guidelines and Requirements


## Overview

These are the general, overall guidelines for TVGP (and all related shows).  For more detailed information, please see the additional files in this directory.

## Show Rules
1. No swearing.  
	1. Any swearing that seems like it's "borderline" acceptable for the show likely isn't.  Err on the side of caution to save the editor's time.
1. No use of homophobic or pejoratively sexual language (e.g. gay, faggot, etc.)
	1. The only exceptions to this are when discussing characters that are gay/bi/trans/etc
1. Don't hate or like something "just because."  You need to come with a cogent, serious overview of why you do/don't like the thing you're talking about.
